Installation
============

**There has been no release so far in v0.2.x so there are no pre-built binaries.**

GNU/Linux
---------

Pre-Built
^^^^^^^^^

All releases (starting from ``v0.2.0``) have pre-built binaries.
There will be a Debian package for Ubuntu and Debian, and two Python wheel files.

If you are unable to install one or more of those, please see the "From Source"
section below.

To install the Debian package:

``sudo dpkg -i pvid_x.x.x.deb``

To install the wheel files:

``pip install pv_...whl``

File names vary.

From Source
^^^^^^^^^^^

First build the files. Instructions are `here <../dev/build.html>`__

Then, install the files as above.

Windows and Mac

If you are using Windows or MacOS, switch to GNU/Linux and
