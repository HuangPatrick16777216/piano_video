PianoSynth
==========

This is a plan for an idea I have, which is a software synthesizer
specifically for piano.

I will structure it similar to FFmpeg: Libraries which do the synthesizing,
and a convenient command line tool.

The libraries will likely be written in C++ (and cuda if needed), and the
CLI tool will be written in Python.

You can track the progress in ``piano_video/src/pianosynth``.

More updates coming!
