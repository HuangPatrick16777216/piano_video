API
===

**For API documentation, see** `API <../enduser/api.html>`__

This is a pure Python library that doesn't do much computationally, but must
be easy and intuitive for add-on developers.

The API **cannot** be changed without prior notice in the docs, so if you intend to
improve this area, you will most likely be doing docstrings, type hinting, etc.

The API source can be found in ``/src/pv``
